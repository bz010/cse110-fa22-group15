#### The agenda of what is discussed
- **Any old unresolved business from the previous meeting**
    - What exactly are we going to do? 
    - Any remaining ideas from the others?
- **Any new business to be discussed**
    - We discussed what our app should at the very least do
    - How to specialize our app from just "generic calorie counter" to "... calorie counter"
- **Anything that was on the agenda but was not discussed (save for next meeting's old business**
    - We need to figure out how we are going to figure out how many calories someone ate (databases that generalize calories per food)
    - What is our presentation going to look like?
- **Any decisions made & their reasoning (if there were dissenting opinions include them, then write why the group decided to make that decision anyways)**
    - Decided that we would be working on a calorie tracker since it was something we could all understand
    - We should do a calorie tracker to help people gain weight and lose weight
​
