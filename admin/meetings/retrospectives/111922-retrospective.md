## Retrospective 2
### Date: Nov 19 2022
### What went well?
- We were able to succesfully split up and delegate tasks between the FrontEnd and BackEnd
- We met with our TA in person for the first time 
- FIx a lot of front-end problems and make the website look better
- Wireframe and Webpage matched
- We have a clear idea on what the final product will be
- Get a logo and name
- We managed to do our tasks and discussed about our websites design.
- Meeting up with someone on the backend and doing a knowledge exchange
### What didn't go well?
- Split unit testing into a separate group when they should be working with everyone
- ADR on naming unclear
- There's some confusion here and there between the different subgroups
- We haven't done with the local storage and CI/CD pipelines 
- Unable to get full attendance at meetings which makes it hard for everyone to be on the same page.
