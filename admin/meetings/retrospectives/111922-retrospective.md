## Retrospective 2
### Date: Nov 19 2022
### What went well?
- We were able to succesfully split up and delegate tasks between the FrontEnd and BackEnd
- FIx a lot of front-end problems and make the website look better
- Wireframe and Webpage matched
- We have a clear idea on what the final product will be
- Get a logo and name
- We managed to do our tasks and discussed about our websites design.
- Meeting up with someone on the backend and doing a knowledge exchange
### What didn't go well?
- We didn't document everything us much as we should
- Split unit testing into a separate group when they should be working with everyone
- Hard to communicate with everyone/TA when doing zoom/in-person meeting
- ADR on naming unclear
- There's some confusion here and there between the different subgroups
- We haven't done with the local storage and CI/CD pipelines
- Without much knowledge about the front-end, the back-end wasn't able to make much progress. We didn't know what exactly to test on so our CI/CD pipeline has not been updated
- Unable to get full attendance at meetings which makes it hard for everyone to be on the same page.
