# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
How to implement the create feature (add-a-food to the food log)? 

## Considered Options

* Manually input the common food information (name, calories/g) to a JSON file.
* Utilize food database api ([Suggestic](https://suggestic.com/api.html), [Nutritionix](https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api), [Fatsecret](https://platform.fatsecret.com/api/)) to import food information.
* Download a csv file for food database ([CORGIS Dataset Project](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/food/)), and use python/java/... to store the needed data in a local JSON file.
* For user's food history, we can prompt the user to input their food taken in a form and then store the form data in local storage or a separate JSON file when submitting the form.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: TODO
