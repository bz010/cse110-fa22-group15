## Context and Problem Statement
How to implement the delete feature (remove an entry in the food log)? 

## Considered Options

* For removing food information, which should be an admin operation, we can directly delete the entry in the  javascript object.
* For removing user's food history entries, which should be a user operation, we can first show the user their food history where each entry holds a unique ID, and prompt them to enter the ID of the entry they want to delete. Then we can delete that corresponding entry in the local storage, which will be triggered by a user action, such as pressing the delete button.  


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: TODO
