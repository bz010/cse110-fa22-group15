# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
What features/design choices should be added/removed/changed from the first high-fidelity wireframes? 

## Considered Options

* Instead of a delete button next to each food entry, we have a checkbox and at the bottom is a "delete all marked" entries button.
* Add a "Welcome, Username" text at the top of the page
* Use https://hookagency.com/blog/website-color-schemes-2020/ to find a color combo for the website theme 

## Decision Outcome
All of the above options were incorporated into the wireframes.
