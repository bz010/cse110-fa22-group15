# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
What will the wireframe look like/what features will it have? 

## Considered Options

* We can do a separate page for each data entry question (weight, height, sex) or have it all on one.
* We can do a pop-up box, a pop-down menu, or something else for the adding a meal to the food log.
* For the default food log, we can either do daily or monthly. The calories progress bar at the top would also be one of those two options.

## Decision Outcome

We decided to create separate pages for each question because this will make the sign-up experience easy to follow. For the same reason, we decided on a pop-up box when adding an entry (similar to when you go to submit an assignment on canvas). Lastly, we decided to have the food log show the daily stats because it would be less cluttered and makes more sense practically since the user would only have to focus on their daily calorie count rather than plan out a whole week.
