# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
How to store the users data (i.e. body measurements, food entries) via local storage? 

## Considered Options

* We can set an entry in local storage that takes the username as the key and their body measurements and food entries as the value.
* We can also store user's body measurements and food entries in a JSON file and prompt the user to save it to their computer, so they can keep the history if they change computer/browsers/etc.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: TODO
