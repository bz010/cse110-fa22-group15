# Decide how to create an entry and how it shows up

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to figure out how we will add a new food entry and delete it since users will need to add and delete.

## Considered Options

* Use a framework like knockout
* Utilize something similar to the Recipe-Card

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We chose the second option because we are not supposed to use frameworks when we don't have to.
