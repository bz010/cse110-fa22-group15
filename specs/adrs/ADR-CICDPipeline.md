# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
What to implement in the CI/CD pipeline? 
- Build -> Test -> Merge -> Relaease -> Deploy -> Repeat

### Context
- In the Calorie Tracker Project, we decide to adopt the practice of infrastructure as code, but we need to decide how we'll apply those code changes to the system.

## Considered Options

* Using the pattern of **continuous integration and continuous delivery** to apply infrastructure changes. 
  * This will be a dedicated pipeline for infrastructure changes that will exist in addition to any CICD pipelines that we deploy for the website code. Using CICD allows us to apply good code based change practices to the infrastructure code.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: TBD
