# Decide who to pair up from frontend and backend

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to do a knowledge exchange in order for frontend and backend to be aware of what the other
team is doing. 

## Considered Options

* There are multiple pairings possible but we wanted to see which people on front end needed backend help
* Michelle/ Eric Chen #2 and Ben Zhang/Alex Towfigh

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: We chose the second option because that's who needed help from the backend and who decided to
help.
