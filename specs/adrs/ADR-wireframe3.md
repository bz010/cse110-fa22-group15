# Create Calories Tracker Website

## Context and Problem Statement
What features/design choices should be added/removed/changed from the first high-fidelity wireframes? 

## Considered Options

* For the pop-up box that appears when the "add food" button is pressed it should have a datalist (drop-down menu that you can type in to) for the food name
* We can look into tying in a food data api so their are food options in the drop-down menu
* Another thing that could be done after is use a food data api so that when the user selects a food, the calories auto-fills in with the options of them editing it
* The pop-up box should have a "meal time" drop-down menu with breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack options
* The last data entry in the pop-up box should be the number of calories.

## Decision Outcome
All of the above options were incorporated into the wireframes and planned to be implemented in the website.
