## How They Would Use Our Website 
Ideally our website would offer the option of choosing to set a goal of gaining weight upon the initial set-up process. Jim could choose this and input how much weight he is looking to gain and by when. Then, the website would calculate how many calories Jim needs to eat per day/week in order to achieve his desired weight. This would allow Jim to keep track of his progress and inform him on when he is too far ahead or behind reaching his goal. 

Jim represents anyone who wants to gain some weight, but doesn't really know how. Our website would provide a general layout for how they can do so by helping them track how many calories they are eating.
