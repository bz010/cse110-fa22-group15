## How They Would Use Our Website 
Our website will offer the option of choosing to set a goal of losing weight upon the initial set-up process. Steve would choose this and input how much weight he is looking to lose. Then, the website would calculate the maximum number of calories Steve can eat per day/week in order to achieve his desired weight. This would allow Steve to keep track of his progress and inform him on when he is too far ahead or behind reaching his goal. 

Steve represents anyone who wants to lose some weight, but doesn't really know how. Our website would provide a general layout for how they can do so by helping them track how many calories they are eating.
