As a university student, I don't have time to cook myself and eat random stuff everyday, so I want to record what I have day to day.

As a person who wants to lose/add weight scientifically, I want to measure the amount of calories I take everyday.

As a person who wants to lose/add weight without knowing the formula of weight changing, I want to get recommendation of how I should change my daily diet.
